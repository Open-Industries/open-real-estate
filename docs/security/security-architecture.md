# Security Architecture

Security viewpoint (VP-7). The management system is ISO/IEC 27001; controls are mapped to
ISO/IEC 27002 in `iso-27001-27002-control-mapping.md`; the threat model is in
`threat-model.md`.

## 1. Trust boundaries

flowchart LR
    EXT[Untrusted: internet / channels] -->|TLS 1.2+, OIDC| GW[API Gateway - boundary 1]
    GW -->|mTLS, workload identity| MESH[Platform namespace - boundary 2]
    MESH --> SVC[Services]
    SVC -->|per-service credentials, TLS| DB[(Databases)]
    PROV[External providers] -->|webhooks, signed| GW
    OPS[Operators] -->|SSO + MFA, audited| PLAT[Platform control plane]
```

## 2. Identity, data protection, application rules

- Consumers: OAuth 2.1 + PKCE against the adopter's IdP; gateway validates JWTs
  (`OIDC_ISSUER` is configuration). Service-to-service: mTLS; deny-by-default policies.
- Data protection: Land-registry references are validated at listing and never stored or returned in clear — only a masked form is kept. Parties' personal data stays in adopter CRM/legal systems; all data here is synthetic. Secrets: platform secret store only, injected as
  environment variables; CI secret scanning; no secrets in this repository.
- Application rules (binding): input validation on every DTO; RFC 9457 errors without
  internals; idempotency on creates; audit logging (actor, timestamp, correlation id,
  business reference) on every state change; BOM-managed dependencies scanned in CI.
